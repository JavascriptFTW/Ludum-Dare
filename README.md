# About

This is a repository of the various projects that I've created for during Ludum Dare game jams.

## LD33

### Theme

You are the monster

### Description

My entry to Ludum Dare 33. This was my first jam so it's not the best, but it's a bit fun.

The goal is to become the scariest monster on the map. You do so by "scaring" other monster which are less scary than yourself (smaller). The gameplay is very agar.io-ish. I believe that there may be a very large "boss" on a platform floating outside of vision range.

### Installation

Download `ScarinessGameDownload.rar` extract it and run `ScarinessGame.exe`. Have fun!
