You are the monster
Idea 1:
 Replace all instances of "experience" with whatever I decide to call it (not experience, please no)
 Concept:
  Monsters have a "scariness" level
  Monsters have abilities
  Abilities have upgrades, which can be purchased with experience
  Powerups are randomly distributed
  Monsters with somewhat equal "scariness" will be neutral towards each other
  Monsters with lower scariness will run away from ones with higher
  You play in a world of monsters
  Goal: Become the scariest monster
  Humorous, very meta
  Cartoonish
  Player gains experience by scaring smaller monsters and loses experience by being near scarier ones
  AI monsters are neutral towards each other (explain this somehow within the game world)
 How to put risk in?
  Health?
  Player loses scariness when near scarier monsters ("Oh look! The coward is scared!")
